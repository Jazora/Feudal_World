* Scripted scene props (starting with pw) do not work in this mode, only on a dedicated server.^\
* Make sure the first few scene props placed are not scripted (start with pw): instance id 0 can't be handled by some scripts.^\
* Factions are numbered from 0 - 9, with commoners = 0, outlaws = 1, and the 4 castle factions starting from 2.^\
* Castles are numbered from 2 - 9, and start the mission owned by the corresponding castle faction: for example, the default 'White Faction' starts with castle 3.^\
* Factions are enabled for the scene if at least one capture point is placed for their starting castle.^\
* Spawn points are 0 - 4 for commoners, 10 - 14 for outlaws, 20 - 24 for castle 1, and so on, up to 90 - 94 for castle 8.^\
* For rotating scene props like trees or destroyable doors, place the origin at or slightly above ground level.^\
* Make sure to adjust ships to the right height for the water level on the hull, as the scripts will use that since each ship mesh has a different height.^\
* Place at least one castle sign for every castle (or capturable area), so the stats chart and capture messages will use proper names.^\
* The scene props starting with code_ should not be placed manually in your scene: they are spawned by the scripts as needed.^\
* Fish schools should be placed somewhere in water, and will move randomly to nearby shallow parts.^\
* The maximum number of lights in a scene that will be visible is 10: a limitation of the game engine.^\
* The lift platform must be linked with two corresponding winches, which will determine the vertical movement range: the plaform will be able to move between 1 unit below the upper winch to 1 unit below the lower one.^\

-----------------------------------------------------------^\
^The values can be modified in the scene editor panel, scene prop section: the two fields, labelled 'Var No' and 'Var 2 No'. These can each store an integer in the range 0 - 127.^\
^The scene props with 'value 1 = faction + multiplier' share the same code for storing a combination of faction id / castle id and gold value multiplier in value 1:^\
0 is the commoner faction, which normally means the prop is not associated with any faction, 1 for outlaws, and 2 - 9 associate the scene prop with a castle (which starts owned by the corresponding faction id).^\
The other part is a multiple of 10, representing specific gold value multipliers:^\
0 = 100%, the default value^10 = 20%^20 = 40%^30 = 60%^40 = 80%^50 = 120%^60 = 140%^70 = 160%^80 = 180%^90 = 200%^100 = 350%^110 = 500%^120 = 1000%^\
These two separate values are combined: for example, 31 = outlaw faction and 60% value, 116 = castle 5 (starts owned by faction 5, the yellow faction) and 500% value.^\
^The scene props with 'value 2 = linking id with x' mean that they are designed to be linked to another scene prop, x representing the first scene prop's name:^\
On scene load, the props are linked by searching for the nearest prop in the scene of the specified type, with the same value 2, and that hasn't already been linked; so for example, with a teleport door pair on opposite sides of the scene, you could set the value 2 of both to 53 and not use that number for any of the other props of the same type, so they are linked correctly even when not close together, or if someone else adds more props of the same type in between."),

Healing arts are difficult to master, requiring many hours careful study as a medical doctor for the best results; though certain peasant healers learn unconventional methods passed down from the generations before them, that give limited results. For a dangerously hurt patient, whether man or beast, it is generally required to use a carefully crafted surgeon's scalpel to operate on the wound, but for moderate wounds rest and food is often all that is required for a complete recovery.^^\
Healing herbs found in certain locations can be cut from the bushes with a knife, then applied to a poisoned wound as an antidote; larger amounts of poison absorbed could require multiple herb leaves. The healing herbs have long green leaves branching off in finger shaped patterns, with bunches of small blue flowers near the top.^\
Poisonous herbs can also sometimes be found, which are then applied to the blades of certain weapons used for murderous deeds; they have many brown stalks covered in tiny green leaves."),
